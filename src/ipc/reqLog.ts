//! Central request-error recorder (last-resort capture layer).
//!
//! Previously, request failures were handled independently at call sites and most disappeared into `void` or
//! empty catch blocks. Critical failures such as the initial tree load or server-rejected WS produced no UI
//! signal and required external evidence to diagnose (see the closed "empty sidebar after SSH remote-window
//! reconnect" issue under docs/issues/closed).
//!
//! This module is the mandatory convergence point for request failures, called from transport.invoke's catch:
//! - **Record and broadcast only; never retry.** Commands with side effects must not be resent automatically here.
//! - Retain the latest N entries in a ring buffer for the Error Log panel and debugging. WKWebView has no console,
//!   so this buffer is the on-site evidence.
//! - Also write to console.error where development, Chrome, or Electron consoles are available.
