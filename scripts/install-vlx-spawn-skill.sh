# Install vlx-term's bundled skills into the user-level Claude and Codex skill directories, making these commands
# available in every vlx-term session:
#   /vspawn <task>        — Spawn a child session in the current directory without a worktree by default.
#   /vspawn-tree <task>   — Spawn a child session with a dedicated Git worktree.
#   /vopen <file|URL>     — Open a file/URL in vlx-term's center pane, matching the terminal vopen command.
#   /vtell <session> <message> — Send a message with the originating session's identity.
#
# These are only explicit entry points. Commands with the same names on PATH do the actual work; vlx-term extracts
# them at startup and injects them into every session's PATH, so they require no installation. This script installs
# only the wrappers invoked explicitly in Claude/Codex conversations. The Vela Skills toggle in application
# settings manages the same set and rewrites them at startup to keep them current.
#
# Usage: scripts/install-vlx-spawn-skill.sh
